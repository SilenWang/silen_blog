Time flies... There are not many days left in 2023, but I haven't written anything from August to December...

Actually, I've learned a lot of new things these months, both at work and outside of it. But I haven't had time to organize or write about them, and I might forget them soon...

So when I saw a blogger's post earlier (I can't find the source, hhhhh), they were right. Many tech bloggers get caught up in fiddling with various blog frameworks and flashy plugins, and end up neglecting the act of writing itself due to distractions and mistakes.

I will continue to stick to writing, regardless of how good dual-link notes or other tools are. Continuously writing and organizing is the most important thing. After all, work never ends; it's just busy and busier. I still need to worry and be anxious, and even more so because life has become busier with more trivial matters, leading to increased anxiety...
