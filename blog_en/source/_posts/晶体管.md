This is a very distinctive game with stunning visuals. It's a strategy game wrapped in an ARPG skin. The story narrative is a bit like Souls games (if you don't explore the hidden information, you won't know what it's about). I remember this being the first game I bought on Steam when the region was just opened (it took a few days to arrive), and that's how I started following the development team. Later, I also completed Bastion and later Pyre (I haven't opened Pyre yet...).
