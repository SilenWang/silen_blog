In 2019, to play Monster Hunter XX, I bought a 3DS. From then on, I started buying various devices to play specific games... I formed a PC group for Dragon's Dogma, bought a PSV for Persona 4 Golden, and got an NSL for Re:Zero. The most expensive one was the Quest2 for Rhythm Heaven. At the end of 19, I planned to record what games I played each year... But fate is not on my side... The pandemic came, and my work suddenly became much more demanding... Playing games had to rely on late-night spending, so I didn't have the energy to do much reflection, only expressing a little bit of feeling about some games.

So, three years passed... Since getting an NSL, I basically stopped playing 3DS, PSV, and PC. For some reason, from being a PC+mobile player, I became a console player... Over the past three years, the games I've played are roughly:

Hmm... It seems that no matter how busy my work is, I don't seem to play games for too little time (after all, I have to spend late nights playing...

Among these games, the ones with the most feelings are [Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World 2](Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World 2), [Persona](Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal), and [Metroid](Metroid). I'll wait for NieR, Xuan Zhi Ji Xia Zhuan, Xenoblade Chronicles, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Magical Night, and Persona 5 Royal to be completed or reach a certain level before filling in the blanks.
