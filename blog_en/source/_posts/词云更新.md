Those Bioinfo projects at my new workplace are mostly personalized, so each project inevitably involves reading some new papers. Once again, I've been feeling a headache from reading so many english papers. It occurred to me that the last time I created a word cloud was back in 2022. Three years have passed, and it's time to welcome... well, just an update.

<!-- more -->

This update is relatively straightforward. After exporting the bibliography, I generated the word cloud again, but with a slight modification to the text used. Previously, I only extracted the abstract. This time, after reviewing the bibliography, I noticed that many entries only have titles and no abstracts. Moreover, paper abstracts tend to be somewhat formulaic. Therefore, this time I used keywords and titles: if keywords are available, use them; otherwise, use the title.

```python
with open(filepath, 'r') as bibliography_file:
    entries = rispy.load(bibliography_file)
    for entry in entries:
        if 'keywords' in entry:
            text +=  ' '.join(entry['keywords']) + ' '
        else:
            text += entry['title'] + ' '
```

Additionally, thanks to AI suggestions, I discovered the reason why the drawing with a mask failed previously. After adding `Image.open("Sylens_Happy_Background.png").convert("L")`, the mask can now take effect correctly.

The new version is shown below:

For reference, the original version:

Surprisingly... Hmm, the changes aren't as significant as I expected. It seems that over the past year and a half, I've indeed been doing more IT-related work... The feeling of being overwhelmed by papers might be because projects often come in clusters.
