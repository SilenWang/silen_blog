Leaving one job for another, I wonder if it's always going to be a struggle...

<!-- more -->

In July 2017, I finally bid farewell to my student life and officially joined the workforce. My position was a bioinformatics engineer at Tianjin Nuohe Zhiyuan.

In August 2018, after barely managing to complete the handover of tasks, I finally left Nuohe after one year and one month. My new company is Hangzhou Ruipei Gene, and I am still working as a bioinformatics engineer.

I don't have many thoughts about my previous employer. Although I really worked like crazy since getting promoted early, I did learn something and felt that my efforts were rewarded. However, after accidentally learning about the IT department's situation... well, let me shout out my frustration loudly. And wish all my fellow colleagues who are still stuck in this pit to find better opportunities soon and get out of it.
