Since I started using Linux desktop distributions in my sophomore year, I have been constantly switching between different发行 versions. After a few years of fiddling around, I finally settled on Manjaro.

# Mint Migration Record

Due to Ubuntu crashing, during the process of reinstalling Ubuntu, I decided to switch to the world's most popular Linux distribution - Mint. It is said to be more user-friendly and comes with everything out of the box.

However, practice makes perfect... For someone who was already used to Unity, it wasn't that simple...

Installation went smoothly, almost identical to Ubuntu's liveCD. Initially, I thought about not formatting the home directory, but after realizing that yesterday's Ubuntu still had issues, I decided to bite the bullet and format it. After copying some files back, it took me a while to get everything set up.

After logging into the Mint interface, the login window was really more beautiful than Ubuntu, with ultra-high-definition clear photos instead of dark tones. However, after logging in, the interface... It took half a year to get used to Unity's layout, switching back to GNOME/Win-like interfaces was really annoying. Besides the different layouts, Mint's display effects didn't feel as good as Ubuntu for me. Chinese fonts felt blurry, possibly due to Noto Sans? After switching to WenQuanYi Microhei, most places improved, but it still wasn't perfect. Baidu said that WenQuanYi Microhei tends to be blurry when the font size is small... So I directly increased all the font sizes.

## Input Method Settings

Mint doesn't come with any input methods by default. Although Firefox has them, without an input method, you can't fully type in English...

The input method settings are under Language Settings, although it lists supported input methods, there are no packages available in the software sources, so they cannot be installed directly from the Software Center.

- PPA installation code:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fcitx-team/nightly
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fcitx
```

After installation, some dependencies are needed. I didn't use the PPA to install, instead, I went to Language -> Input Method and selected Fcitx to directly install the necessary dependencies. After installation, download Sogou from the Sogou website and install it. Restart (logout whether works or not), and you can use the input method. When reinstalling, I copied my previous Ubuntu's /home over, but the Sogou input method's dictionary didn't seem to be retained.

## Software Installation

- PPA installation:
    * VirtualBox
    * GoldenDict
    * Shadowsocks-Qt5
    * PlayOnLinux
    * Okular
    * WizNote
    * R-base
    * Numix-circle
  
- PPA addition code
  
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hzwhuang/ss-qt5 ppa:wiznote-team ppa:numix/ppa
```

- R-base directly added the source information `deb http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/cran/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/` to the software sources

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
```

- PPA installation

```bash
sudo apt-get install VirtualBox GoldenDict Shadowsocks-Qt5 PlayOnLinux Okular WizNote R-base numix-icon-theme-circle kolourpaint
```

- Deb installation
	* mendeley
	* haroopad
	* Rstudio
	* bcloud
	* wps

## Configuration Migration

Backup the original /home, after reinstalling, copy it over. Most software configurations will be retained (Firefox plugins, configuration lost, reason unknown)

## Program Settings

Since I was already used to Unity, I made some adjustments to the Mint interface to lower the adaptation difficulty.

- Panel moved up
- User小程序 placed at the far left

## Firefox Settings and Plugins

Due to Firefox configuration loss, I'm recording related settings here to prevent them from being lost again next time.

- Using plugins:
	* Adblock Plus
	* FxoyProxy
	* Hide Cpation Titlebar Plus
	* Stylish

- Stylish setting (another post has it, repeating the record)
- 
```
@-moz-document regexp("https?://(?!.+\\.coursera\\.org).*"){
*:not([class*="icon"]):not(i){font-family: "WenQuanYi Microhei"  !important;}
    span.fui-logo-text{font-family: "IterCast-Icon"  !important;}
    span.diffstat-bar{font-family: "octicons"  !important;}
    span.diff-added{font-family: "octicons"  !important;}
    #indexbutton{font-family: "html5test"  !important;}

    .panel ins a{font-family: "2345"  !important;}
    span.nba_matchnav_score{font-family: "Sans-Serif"  !important;}
}
```

## Ubuntu Unity vs Mint Cinnamon Usage Comparison

- Display effects/Interface layout

Personally, I'm more used to Unity. Although Ubuntu's default colors aren't very appealing, after installing Numix themes and changing the wallpaper, it still looks quite nice. Unity places the program panel on the left, and the top panel for integrating title bars. This design is indeed saving a lot of space on 16:9 screens, allowing more content to be displayed. And Ubuntu's default fonts and icons are quite large, making them easier to adapt after switching back to Windows or Mint. The display effects of Ubuntu also seem better than Mint, possibly because the fonts are larger, using WenQuanYi Microhei won't be blurry...

- Usability

Mint is indeed more user-friendly than Ubuntu. It's no wonder it has the highest click-through rate. Mint provides a higher degree of graphicalization in its settings center, integrating many more options compared to Ubuntu. The login window software sources can be managed very conveniently through GUI. File operations have right-click menu options to open with root privileges without needing command-line operations. Of course... once you know the path, dragging and dropping is actually quite fast.

Details are also very贴心, for example, when opening a manager with root privileges, there will be special prompts, avoiding the confusion that Ubuntu users often encounter. 

Mint's panel extensions and theme switching are also very convenient, with resources directly downloadable without needing to find them separately.

Of course, because I migrated from Unity back then, some habits have a significant impact on usability. If it were for someone who directly migrated from Windows, Mint would be extremely user-friendly. Then I think in terms of software updates, Mint really does a great job... It sets special protection for core parts, preventing users from easily updating the kernel, which is very friendly to me as a half-newbie with强迫症 (I don't know if my previous Ubuntu was because of an update that crashed).

- Small problems
From 3 years ago when I first used various Ubuntu-based distributions, small issues have never stopped. Due to the large user base of Windows, font乱码 is completely unavoidable. Besides some scattered issues that may not affect usage... we can only wait for future fixes.
	* Ubuntu-related small problems
		1. Dual graphics card, independent graphics card driver (could not be solved)
		2. Touchpad (turned on by default at boot)
		3. Screen brightness (could not remember the last brightness setting)
		4. Error reports (unknown error prompts that don't have any actual impact)
		5. Occasionally freezes when watching videos for a long time
		6. Occasionally lags, I'm not sure why it lags (not many programs running)
	* Mint-related small problems
		1. Dual graphics card, independent graphics card driver
		2. Screen brightness
		3. Occasionally lags
		4. Sleep/suspend cannot wake up
		5. Fonts always feel a bit blurry
		6. Some wireless mice automatically go to sleep
		7. Firefox download menu clicking on open file location makes Firefox freeze

## Interface Reorganization
Sometimes, when I'm bored, I do boring things. Recently, for some reason, I felt that looking at my desktop wasn't very satisfying and decided to start tweaking.
Basically, it boils down to preferring Unity's layout style, although many people find this strange, after accepting this setting... really feels quite cool.... Unfortunately, the graphics card driver I couldn't figure out.

At first, my Mint layout was like this:
![](http://7xluqf.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/desktop-2016-02-14%2014:26:36%E7%9A%84%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE.png)

Basically, it was like Win (and XP) under the menu->quick start->open windows, notification bar. Initially, when switching from Ubuntu to Windows, I still retained the window button left placement, but after repeatedly mis-clicking the menu, I eventually switched back to the right...

But using it for a while felt that the position of the open windows in the middle was too small, and with four or more window tabs, they would be partially obscured, making it difficult to switch between them....

So I tried using dock tools to replace the toolbar's quick start, resulting in this layout:
![](http://7xluqf.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/desktop-2016-02-28%2016:51:03%E7%9A%84%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE.png)
Ah, a little bit like Unity! But not as good as Unity.....
I tried using the toolbar mode, but docky was blocked by the system自带 toolbars....
This layout used for a few days and then I found problems, after all, quite many software have buttons or menus on the left side.... Habitually flying my mouse over would often mistakenly open other programs....

So, I still put docky at the bottom...
![](http://7xluqf.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/desktop-2016-03-06%2021:56:24%E7%9A%84%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE.png)
= =|||Ah....So my desktop layout became similar to most GNOME2-era users.......Was this arrangement really tested?......So my struggles were meaningless?...God...

# Mint to Manjaro

## From Ubuntu-based to Arch-based

I started trying Linux systems from my junior year, and I've always been using Ubuntu and its derivative distributions. This time, switching to a Manjaro based on Arch is quite a big change. Actually, before the switch, I was very anxious, after all, I'm known for being blacklisted.... And although I've used Linux for a long time, I'm still considered a beginner in Linux, so I was afraid that during the process, I might cause serious problems and crash my computer..... However, from this experience, things went well. To date, it has been exactly one week since switching systems, and all the commonly used software I need have been successfully installed (including games), there haven't been any severe issues hindering use (although there are many small bugs scattered around...), and I plan to continue running for two more months. If everything goes well in the next two months, I might consider uninstalling Mint.

## Why Choose Manjaro

Because it's simple! Although I was recommended to switch to Arch-based systems, since I'm not very familiar with Linux, I didn't consider installing the original Arch directly, instead, I searched for a popular Arch derivative on DistrioWatch, which is now what I'm using - Manjaro. 
Although true Arch fans might think this belongs to heresy... because Manjaro doesn't follow Arch's principle of being as minimalistic as possible and leaving everything up to the user, but for me, who wants to experience Pacman but don't want to spend too much time reading Arch Wiki, Manjaro is a very good solution...

## Installation Plan
Since this was my first time using a Linux system other than Ubuntu-based ones, I naturally chose a dual-boot installation plan to leave myself an escape route.
My laptop's hard drive uses GPT partitioning, and I only installed one Linux Mint, no Windows at all. Solving the boot problem was quite convenient, during installation, I set Manjaro to install its Grub2 into the existing EFI partition, then manually deleted the Linux Mint's EFI files in the EFI partition.
There were two reasons for directly deleting:
1. From Mint's Grub2, it couldn't correctly boot Manjaro, but Manjaro's Grub2 could correctly boot Mint, the reason was unclear, possibly because Mint's version was too low?
2. I didn't know how to let the system automatically choose to use Manjaro's installed Grub2, so I just deleted Mint's and left only Manjaro's.
Overall, the installation went quite smoothly, similar to installing Ubuntu or Mint, just a few mouse clicks were needed. However, after the first installation, I tried fiddling with the graphics card drivers, and then the desktop resolution became abnormal and couldn't be restored, so I reinstalled it again....

## Manjaro(Cinnamon Edition) vs Linux Mint Comparison
### Desktop Environment
Manjaro supports multiple desktop environments, to reduce my migration resistance, I chose the version with Cinnamon. So although they are different systems, their appearance looks almost the same, in terms of default installed software, there are some differences:

- Some system options and driver management need to be done using "Manjaro Setting Manager", while Mint's settings are all integrated into the settings panel.
- In Mint 17, language and input method were located under the same setting item, allowing simultaneous management of language and input method. In Manjaro, there is only an independent language setting item in "Manjaro Setting Manager" with no input method management.
- For dual graphics card computers, Manjaro defaults to installing bumblebee, and there are no Nvidia Prime-related software packages in the software library, speculation that Arch-based systems use bumblebee for dual graphics card switching.
- The package manager software is different from the source update software.
- Manjaro does not have a default font management program.
- Calculator programs are different.

### Chinese Localization

In this aspect, Manjaro is much better than Mint. After selecting Chinese during installation, most of the Chinese localization was completed (including Gimp / Firefox / Libre Office). And for subsequent installed software with Chinese language packages, they would also be installed together, such as Okular / Kolour Paint these KDE-based software.
While Mint 17 often has incomplete Chinese localization, after installing the system, only some common menu items are Chinese. Gimp / Firefox / Libre Office are all English, and you need to reinstall the language package yourself. And for subsequent installed software, they will always be in default English.

### Font Effects

Without any configuration, personally, I feel that Manjaro's font effects are slightly worse than Mint. This was a surprise to me because I previously used the Live CD to experience Manjaro's KDE version, and the fonts looked quite comfortable. Using the system settings' font item for simple adjustments still felt like it wasn't as good as Mint, feeling that Chinese characters had special blurriness... However, this can be solved by installing fontconfig-ubuntu and freetype2-ubuntu packages, after installation, you can get consistent display effects with Mint.

### Common Software Acquisition

A system based on Ubuntu, one based on Arch, naturally have different software package management. Arch is loved by many users for its almost everything available and always keeping the latest in its software repositories.
The official repository and AUR indeed have what software there is, all the software I used in U-series systems can be found in both the official repository and AUR. And like Rstudio / sogou-pinyin / WPS / Steam etc., some software previously required downloading deb packages or adding PPA sources for installation, but after switching to Manjaro, a single command or clicking a few times in Pamac could solve it.
However, this convenience is established on the condition of good network environment. 
In my school's campus network, which is often unstable and slow, theoretically with a download speed of 512kb/s, actual usage is generally only 100-200kb/s, if downloading from overseas websites, the speed could be as low as 50kb/s... So the software installation experience was really quite bad...... especially when installing from AUR, even though you don't need to confirm, most packages require entering a password to get permissions. Because of the slow download speed and long time, it's not possible to automatically install while installing software, I have to stand by one by one entering passwords...... and sometimes it can't be installed successfully......
Good that there is an "archlinuxcn" source provided by Arch enthusiasts for domestic users, which has many packages from AUR that download very fast and install without any errors. [According to ArchWiki's guidance to add "archlinuxcn" source](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#archlinuxcn) after adding it, I successfully installed most of the commonly used software.
Worth mentioning is that during the installation process, I found that not all software in the Arch repository are kept up to date. For example, R.
The official Arch repository provides version 3.2.4 of R, while the latest version is 3.3.0. Although AUR's r-kml is the latest 3.3.0 version, I was afraid it might cause installation issues so I didn't consider using it.
If using Mint, you can easily get the latest R through adding third-party PPAs, but in Arch-based systems, this cannot be done, so in the end, I chose to compile and install it, see the detailed installation process in my previous [another post](http://blog.leanote.com/post/silenseek/R-3.3.0-%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85-Arch).

### Graphics Card Drivers

Linux's dual graphics card drivers have always been a problem I couldn't figure out, which was also the main reason for me to migrate from the original Ubuntu to Mint: being able to install graphics card drivers in one click.
Perhaps Manjaro shares similar design ideas with Mint, so in terms of graphics card drivers, it does quite well. The system installs all drivers by default and there are no major issues when using them. However, I used Nvidia-prime for switching graphics cards in Mint, while Manjaro seems to only use Bumblebee. Recently, since I only play炉石传说和火炬之光2, I don't really need the dedicated GPU, so I haven't bothered with it...

### Input Method

Manjaro doesn't have a dedicated input method management item, directly installing input methods from the library is fine. It's true that the Sogou Pinyin feels very good! Although I was used to Rime in Mint before, overall, it still isn't as convenient as Sogou! Pray that fcitx won't disappear again! I switched systems and you can't let me down!!!!!!

### Small Bugs and Issues

I don't know if my face is really black, but from the moment I started using Linux, various small bugs have never stopped. This time, after switching from Mint to Manjaro, a part of it was also because Firefox's Flash said it crashed, and I couldn't find a solution........
However, I switched to Manjaro......still encountered various small bugs continuously.....Organized them, the small bugs and issues encountered since switching to Manjaro are:

- Leanote default editor font is abnormal (solved after upgrading the kernel)
- Vivaldi installing flash causes flashing (gave up using it)
- Startup prompt: [failed] failed to start setup virtual console (already solved)
- Startup without mouse pointer, re-login shows pointer ([already solved](http://cncc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=Mouse+cursor+won%27t+appear+on+startup&d=4702496862111540&mkt=zh-CN&setlang=zh-CN&w=bFoHO6AgL5lacrZXtcV-NuAyXavoIkTi))
- Using screenshot program's area screenshot function, the program does not respond (not solved)
- unzip solves乱码 invalid (already solved)
- Font blurry (already solved)
- Steam cannot be started directly (already solved)
- Neemo cannot lock to docky after starting, because docky recognizes it as root manager (not solved)
- Rstudio cannot input Chinese (not solved)
- Telegram cannot input Chinese (already solved)
- PDF does not display Chinese (already solved)
- Desktop display is abnormal, only low resolution can be used (reason unknown, reinstallation solves)
- Text dragging and copying, dragging cannot cross windows through the panel (not solved)
- Rename does not support regular expressions (already solved)
- Global shortcuts occasionally fail (not solved)

...There are so many problems, that my friends said, you're not using Arch, but a version of Arch filled with bugs...
However, above issues did not significantly affect usage, and my computer can normally hibernate/suspend, the failure rate of global shortcuts is also not as severe as in Mint. So overall, I successfully completed the migration from Mint to Manjaro.

### Learning Resources
Arch Wiki's detailed and meticulous content has always been praised by all Arch users and some non-Arch users. After using one week of an Arch derivative, I have a bit of experience with this too. But for me, compared to Ubuntu and its derivatives, searching for solutions to problems in Arch is much more difficult.
For example, the problem of Vivaldi installing Flash causing flashing, I directly searched "Arch Vivaldi Flash flashing" on Chinese/Bing/Google but couldn't find any useful results......
Considering that Vivaldi is a small crowd within a small crowd, so changing "Vivaldi" to "Chrome" / "Chromium", still couldn't find any useful results......This was quite awkward...
Actually, in Mint, I directly searched Chinese, if I really couldn't find anything, then I would search English. After all, Mint is based on Ubuntu, and the number of users using Ubuntu domestically is still quite a lot, most of the time you can find effective solutions. Even if you can't find an effective solution, through the Chinese search results, you can get a preliminary understanding of the problem, and then try to search for English results to find the solution.
Switching to Manjaro isn't like that, not only are there few domestic users of Manjaro (no灌水 in forums/bbs), but even the active degree of Archlinux Chinese forum/bbs is far from Ubuntu, so the difficulty of searching in Chinese is really high by a notch or two. 
Although many Linux problems are similar, using "Linux" as a keyword can get some problem solutions, but it's not as convenient and quick as directly using "Ubuntu" as a keyword.

## After Migration Reflection
Over one week, I can now complete all the things I previously completed on Manjaro, although there are still small bugs (like before...), there are also many surprises (Sogou works, hibernate/suspend works normally) supporting me to continue using it. Looking forward to Manjaro staying stable for the next two months.......As for the kernel......should I update or not update good?

## Acknowledgment
Herein, I solemnly thank the person who introduced me into this! Having someone who has used it before is always more reassuring~

## Desktop Screenshot Remembrance
Actually, the screenshots really don't show much difference, after all, both are Cinnamon, and both have similar themes...

# Manjaro Interface Settings (manjaro)
Today I saw a video on YouTube about Manjaro Deepin 16.08 experience,
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMsOtFfrl6s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I couldn't help but download DDE to try.

It turns out that the Deepin team has put a lot of effort into making software, the latest Deepin 15.3 is quite smooth, and the entire interface design is simple and beautiful (in my opinion, second only to KDE...), feeling very promising~ 
However, since I've been using it for almost half a year now, switching to DDE feels so empty... Besides, since it's still in development, there are fewer plugins and configurable options (well... for me, it's through GUI configuration) compared to KDE. So although it looks beautiful... 15 minutes later, I uninstalled it and continued with XFCE...

...However... after watching the young and pretty one, returning to my original environment... cough... feels a bit uncomfortable...(I'm also a fickle old man...) so I started various theme changes again... while browsing Pamac's software, I accidentally found a plugin: `xfce4-windowck-plugin`, this plugin can put the title bar and title buttons on the panel, which finally reminded me of Unity...

Thinking about what I said earlier, I still like Unity's layout. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a better solution when configuring it before. With this plugin, although it can't reach Unity's effect (Unity simultaneously integrates the title bar and menu to the panel), it at least saves some space!
Specific plan as follows:

- Install `xfce4-windowck-plugin`
- Put the plugin on the top panel
- In the window manager settings, set the window maximized to hide the title bar
- Set all buttons to the left
- Move the menu button to the left panel, workspace indicator to the bottom panel
- Ding ding ding~

# Manjaro Crashed Afterward
## Crashed so suddenly, had to die big
When I migrated, I thought... with my luck, it would crash at least once within half a year, and sure enough, it did...
On Tuesday 2nd, for an unknown reason, the GUI couldn't enter, stuck at the Manjaro Logo loading place, switching to the console showed nothing... completely didn't know what was wrong, then I urgently needed to use my computer, thinking that previously when reinstalling Mint, I retained home, after reinstalling and mounting home, all software settings and personal files wouldn't be lost, so I thought about not reinstalling!
Then I went! big!! dead!!!了!!!!
Reinstalling entered the GUI instantly confused... my home was formatted!!!
Speculation is that during reinstallation, I accidentally checked to format it...
Ah... really a thunderbolt lightning strike... all my experimental data were in home without backup...
After sulking for half an hour, I started looking for recovery methods, asked several stores on Taobao about data recovery services, but they were all Windows-based... really wanted to cry...
Tried using photorec and testdisk for repair, but it didn't work at all...
On Tuesday night... finally realized the reality, had to start over...(you know what I mean...)
## Desktop Environment Change (don't know how many times)
Anyway, since the whole system needs to be reinstalled and reconfigured, so this time I wanted not only to change the desktop environment this time, but also to try something new. After all, I've always wanted to try the legendary Xfce... Fortunately, Xfce is officially supported by Manjaro, so I directly downloaded Manjaro Xfce prepared for a fresh reinstall.
## Installation Process
Manjaro's various versions are quite simple to install... just click and click... as long as you don't accidentally check to format it like me...
## Xfce vs Cinnamon
Xfce is different from Unity or Cinnamon. Unity and Cinnamon aim to provide beautiful, user-friendly, and feature-rich operating interfaces, while Xfce prioritizes lightness as an important consideration. So the feeling when using them is quite different.
In simple terms, Xfce gives a very very fast feeling! Whether it's starting the computer or loading programs, the speed difference is really visible to the naked eye... This can only be felt after trying. When I switched from Mint to Manjaro Cinnamon, I felt that the speed had a noticeable improvement. Now switching from Cinnamon to Xfce, the speed has improved again. Now reopening Mint feels so slow that it's almost unbearable...
Lightweight & Simple, Xfce fits these two points very well, but for me, who switched from Cinnamon, some small places being too simple made me feel uncomfortable:

- The volume control plugin on the panel is extremely simple... simple to the point where I often don't know how to use this plugin... frequently accidentally adjusting the sound...
- unzip does not support -O parameter... causing zip files to be displayed in乱码.
- Keyboard shortcut settings do not have many preset schemes... need to first find out what command needs to be written to achieve the desired function (my laptop has no dedicated touchpad switch key, I must set up a shortcut myself)...
- The built-in file manager does not support forward and backward keys, and there is no corresponding option in the settings... additionally... this thing really looks nothing like Nemo.
- No disk (program for managing disk partitions and mounting)... instantly confused when setting automatic mount.
- Cannot find the mousepad (text editor) setting anywhere... staring at a white background with small black text made me feel uncomfortable...
- The built-in music player looks like it has many functions but completely doesn't know how to use it... also does not support dragging to open files...
- No network settings page for system proxy, only VPN

These issues are not very big, more belong to suddenly switching desktop environments and not adapting. As a user, I can choose to slowly change habits to adapt, on the other hand, actually, you can modify the environment according to your habits... after all, this is Linux, as long as you want to mess around, most of it can be achieved.
For me personally, Xfce's flying speed gave me enough motivation to continue using it. After all, fancy effects are nice, but there's no object to look at, the feeling of being smooth and comfortable when using is more important...

## Revisiting Arch Wiki
When I switched from U-series to A-series, I felt that A-series system documentation wasn't as rich as U-series. Now after using Manjaro for a month and a half, my opinion has changed. Speaking of this... the documentation is indeed richer than Arch Wiki... in the past month and a half, over 80% of problems could be found in it. Problems that weren't in Arch Wiki were also very difficult to find.
Actually, A-series documentation isn't hard to find, but it's not as user-friendly as U-series.
When using U-series systems, materials online generally include directly runnable problem-solving commands or codes. As long as the description of the problem is consistent, you can copy those few lines of code and run them in the terminal. Arch Wiki is different, when writing, it assumes that the reader has some Linux basics. It writes about the reason for the problem and the solution, but rarely directly provides one-click runnable codes.
From this angle, Arch is not suitable for beginners, but very good for learning Linux.

## System Configuration
My configuration principle is to尽量 fit my original work habits in Cinnamon, so I mainly reconfigured the panel (in the end, actually returned to Gnome2's layout...), deleted some built-in software and replaced them with what I used in Cinnamon. Additionally, Steam's runtime library had issues again in Xfce... previously using local runtime libraries in Cinnamon made all games run normally, but this didn't work in Xfce. So I found another solution from Arch Wiki.
Specifically as follows:

### Replace Volume Control Plugin
- Uninstall the built-in volume control plugin `pa-applet`, install `xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin`, manually add it to the panel (doesn't support appearing in the notification bar)
- Install the above plugin, adjusting the volume will have two volume change notifications. Right-click on the plugin's properties and turn off one (the other might be the system default... don't know how to turn it off).

### Replace unzip package
- Install `unzip-iconv` (archlinuxcn repo) instead of `unzip`

### Set up touchpad switch shortcut key
- Solution from [Arch Wiki: Touchpad_Synaptics#Software_toggle](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics#Software_toggle)
