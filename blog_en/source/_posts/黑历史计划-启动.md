As a former ~~and still~~ chuunibyou ~~uncle~~ teenager, how could I not have any dark history?
<!-- Summary part -->
<!-- more -->

The other day when I was searching for my Google ID, I suddenly remembered that I used to post blogs on NetEase LOFTER and Ant Notes... ~~I'll let the love-hate stories with my ex-girlfriend stay on NetEase Blog~~. I took a quick look and found quite a bit of content. It turns out that I wasn't as asocial back then hhhhhhhh. Since it's just my personal gitpage, why not follow the trend and repurpose the old content? Let's see how past me was... so idle... ~~With hundreds of posts on LOFTER, my mentor is truly generous~~.

Since most of the old content is about daily life, I'll put them all under `Daily`. Because it's a repost, I'll keep the original dates, so these posts won't appear on the homepage. Also, since some short posts don't have much value in republishing, I'll skip those.

That's it.
