chatGPT has been popular for a long time, and I only got an account yesterday because I wanted to use it to generate some content. As many people say on the internet, although he may be a big fool in professional issues, for coding, at least I can run and test myself, getting a rough direction is also good!

<!-- Abstract part -->
<!-- more -->

The background of this problem is as follows:

- I used `mkdocs` to generate a company content technical document (like my manual), which is a static webpage, so adding an HTTP server can directly view it.
- I want to embed this document into the existing system using `iframe`.
- Since this document is important, there are confidentiality requirements, so the document cannot be accessed directly and needs some verification.

After discussing with IT together, the final discussion plan was that he first requested a token from me. I used this token to verify at the API he gave, returning true means legal user. I only know basic flask and fastAPI, and flask is simpler, so in short, I need to write such a program:

- Use flask to build an HTTP server with the same function as python's simple http.server, allowing users to access mkdocs created static website.
- This server needs verification ability, accepting requests containing token after verification, determine if the user is a legal user.
- After the first verification, internal redirects in the static website are handled by this service itself, so I need to find a way to save the token and complete the verification myself.

Although I have used flask and dash before, I basically don't have much concept of web technology. The experience of testing caddy reverse proxy made me feel that this program can definitely be implemented, but the specific implementation is not clear, and at the same time, I understand what it means to save the token, but I don't know how to operate.

At this point, chatGPT came into play. I described my understanding roughly and asked how to write the code I wanted. It didn't give me a completely correct result (of course there were also unclear questions I asked), but it gave me a code example that allowed me to test and guess how to write the program, for unclear parts, then ask for special explanations or require specific instructions, its answer wasn't completely correct (of course there were also unclear questions I asked), but in the discussion process, I indeed gradually found the implementation scheme I wanted.

In the end, I completed this simple program in the morning. Although the program is simple, if it was placed before, I might have to look for several Chinese web pages to see if there are any existing examples that can be referenced, then guess the English description method, and then search on stackoverflow for 10 or so English posts to find the answers to the parts of the problem I want, then try to group out a usable solution... The process wasn't painful, after all it was a reading learning process, but in terms of efficiency, it definitely wasn't good...

Now as long as I can roughly describe what I want, chatGPT can directly give me a code example for me to debug and learn, saving most of the time spent on looking up Chinese materials and English materials, directly jumping to using examples to debug, the efficiency is undoubtedly qualitative change...

Suddenly feel like learning a front-end move or two... Writing websites and apps isn't a dream anymore...

Today chatGPT's requests were too many, temporarily can't use it (don't know how paid users will do), seems early to use early to enjoy... Played may not be able to enjoy free usage either...

How to build a Flask server that uses token for verification?

#### ChatGPT:
To build a Flask server that uses token for verification, you can use the `Flask-JWT` extension. This extension provides JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication mechanism for Flask applications.

Below is a simple Flask application example for verifying user tokens:

First install the required extensions:

```
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-JWT
```

Next, write the Flask application code as follows:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_jwt import JWT, jwt_required, current_identity
from werkzeug.security import safe_str_cmp

# Define user class
class User(object):
    def __init__(self, id, username, password):
        self.id = id
        self.username = username
        self.password = password

# Create a list of users
users = [
    User(1, 'user1', 'password1'),
    User(2, 'user2', 'password2')
]

# Define authenticate and identity methods
def authenticate(username, password):
    for user in users:
        if user.username == username and safe_str_cmp(user.password.encode('utf-8'), password.encode('utf-8')):
            return user

def identity(payload):
    user_id = payload['identity']
    return next((user for user in users if user.id == user_id), None)

# Create a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Set JWT secret key
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'super-secret'

# Create JWT object
jwt = JWT(app, authenticate, identity)

# Create protected route
@app.route('/protected')
@jwt_required()
def protected():
    return jsonify({'user_id': current_identity.id, 'username': current_identity.username})

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this application, we define a `User` class to represent users, then create a user list `users`, containing two users' usernames and passwords. We also define `authenticate` and `identity` methods for verifying when looking up users.

In the Flask application instance, we set a SECRET_KEY and create a JWT object. We also define a protected route `/protected`, which can only be accessed by providing a valid JWT token.

Finally, we run the Flask application. When you access the `/protected` route, you will need to provide a valid JWT token to access that route.

#### You:
This flask server receives a token when it receives a request, I need to use this token to verify at another server and return static content if verification is successful, how should I write it?

#### ChatGPT:
To use the received token in Flask application to verify at another server and return static content if verification is successful, you can use Python's `requests` library, which allows convenient sending of HTTP requests to other servers and obtaining responses.

Below is a simple Flask application example that sends the received token to another server for verification and returns static content:

```python
import requests
from flask import Flask, request

# Create a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define method to verify token
def verify_token(token):
    # Send HTTP request to other server for verification
    response = requests.get('https://example.com/verify-token', headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Create route
@app.route('/')
def index():
    token = request.headers.get('Authorization').split(' ')[1]
    if verify_token(token):
        return 'Hello, world!'
    else:
        return 'Invalid token'

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this application, we define a `verify_token` method that sends the received token to another server for verification and determines whether the token is valid based on the response. We also define a root route `/`, which retrieves the token from the headers of the incoming request and passes it to the `verify_token` method for verification.

If the received token is valid, return `'Hello, world!'`, otherwise return `'Invalid token'`.

Please note that this example is only for demonstration purposes. In an actual application, you need to match the `verify_token` method with your actual verification logic and ensure using the correct verification headers and other parameters.

#### You:
If I want to return not just a simple website but already generated static webpage like mkdocs or gitbook generated static pages, how can I implement it?

#### ChatGPT:
If you want to return already generated static webpages, you can use Flask's `send_from_directory` method. This method is used to return specified files from a specific directory for client download or viewing.

Assuming you have already generated static webpages and stored them in the `static/docs` subdirectory of the `static` directory, you can use the following Flask application code to provide these webpages:

```python
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory

# Create a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Create route
@app.route('/docs/<path:filename>')
def serve_docs(filename):
    return send_from_directory('static/docs', filename)

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this application, we define a `serve_docs` route that returns the specified file from the `static/docs` directory according to the client's request.

For example, if you want to return the `static/docs/index.html` file, you can use the following URL:

```bash
http://localhost:5000/docs/index.html
```

Please note that this is just a basic example. In an actual application, you may need to add other logic such as authentication and access control to ensure only authorized users can access your static webpages.

#### You:
Flask receives requests when how do I get the parameters of GET request?

#### ChatGPT:
Getting parameters from a GET request in Flask is very simple. You can use the `request.args` object to get parameters from the GET request. This object is a dictionary that contains all parameters and their values in the GET request.

For example, if your URL is `http://localhost:5000/search?q=python&page=1`, you can use the following code to get the values of `q` and `page` parameters:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

# Create a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Create route
@app.route('/search')
def search():
    query = request.args.get('q')
    page = request.args.get('page')
    return f'Searching for "{query}" on page {page}'

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this application, we define a `search` route that retrieves `q` and `page` parameters from the GET request and includes them in the returned string.

Please note that the `request.args.get` method returns a string type. If you need to get other types of parameter values (such as integers or booleans), you need to perform appropriate conversions.

#### You:

```python
import requests
from flask import Flask, request, send_from_directory

# Create a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)


# Create route
@app.route('/<path:filename>')
def serve_docs(filename):

    if filename == '':
        filename = 'index.html'
    return send_from_directory(f'static/docs/', filename)

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

#### ChatGPT:
This code serves a Flask application and uses `send_from_directory` to return specified files from the `static/docs` directory in response to client requests. This application listens for the root route `'/'`, and uses the `filename` parameter to specify the file name to be returned.

In this application, we also added some additional logic. If the client requests the root route `'/'`, then by default return `index.html` file.

Please note that if you use this code example to serve your own generated static webpages, make sure to store the files in the `static/docs` directory. You can modify the code by replacing `static/docs` with the actual directory where you store your static webpages.

If you need to implement more advanced features such as authentication and access control, you need to add corresponding logic code. For example, you can use Flask's provided `login_required` decorator to require users to log in before accessing protected pages.

#### You:
Above the code can only access files under the static/docs/ directory, how to write it so that it can access subdirectories?

#### ChatGPT:
If you want to access files under the `static/docs` directory and its subdirectories, you can change the first parameter of `send_from_directory` function to `static`, and treat `filename` as a combination of subdirectory and file name. Specifically, you can use `os.path.join` function to concatenate the path's subdirectory and file name, then pass the result as the second parameter of `send_from_directory` function.

Below is an example code that can access all files under the `static/docs` directory and its subdirectories:

```python
import os
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory

# Create a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Create route
@app.route('/<path:filename>')
def serve_docs(filename):
    if filename == '':
        filename = 'index.html'
    path = os.path.join('static', filename)
    return send_from_directory(path, filename)

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this application, we define a `serve_docs` route that can handle requests for all paths, including subdirectories and file names. We use `os.path.join` function to concatenate the path's subdirectory and file name, then pass the result as the first parameter of `send_from_directory` function. Since this function can handle subdirectories, it can look up any combination of subdirectories and file names in the `static` directory.

Please note that this code example only provides basic routing and file service logic. If you need to implement more advanced features such as authentication and access control, you need to add corresponding logic in your code.

#### You:
Flask if the request is '/' want to redirect to '/index.html' how do I write it?

#### ChatGPT:
To redirect root path `'/'` to `/index.html`, you can use Flask's provided `redirect` function. Below is an example code that can achieve this:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect

# Create a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Create route
@app.route('/')
def redirect_to_index():
    return redirect('/index.html')

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this application, we define a named `redirect_to_index` route that redirects root path `'/'` to `/index.html`. We use Flask's provided `redirect` function to achieve redirection. The parameter of this function is the target URL for redirection.

When the client requests the root path `'/'`, this route function will call the `redirect` function and set its parameter to `/index.html`. This will cause the client to be redirected to the `/index.html` page.

Please note that the redirection feature is implemented based on HTTP protocol's 3xx status codes. Therefore, the client will receive a response with a status code of 302 (Found) and be required to redirect to the new URL.

How to use flask to build a server similar to python's simple https.server that can automatically access built static websites?

#### ChatGPT:
To use Flask to build a server similar to Python's SimpleHTTPServer that provides automatic access to built static websites, you can use Flask's `send_from_directory` function to provide access to static files. Below is a simple Flask application example that can achieve this:

```python
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory

# Create a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Create route
@app.route('/')
def serve_index():
    return send_from_directory('static', 'index.html')

@app.route('/<path:path>')
def serve_static(path):
    return send_from_directory('static', path)

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(ssl_context='adhoc')
```

In this application, we define two routes:

1. `/` route: When a client accesses the root path, it will call the `serve_index` function and return the `index.html` file located in the `static` folder.
2. `/<path>` route: When a client accesses any other path, it will call the `serve_static` function and return the corresponding file located in the `static` folder. The `<path>` parameter can be any path, including subdirectory paths.

When starting the application, we use the `ssl_context='adhoc'` parameter to enable self-signed SSL certificates, enabling HTTPS access. This will make the application listen on port 443 and use self-signed SSL certificates for encrypted communication.

Please note that in the above example code, all static files are stored in the `static` folder. If your static files are stored in another folder, you need to modify the file path of `send_from_directory` function accordingly.

I hope this example will help you build your own Flask static file server. If you have any other questions, please ask.

#### You:
Here's the difference between `path:path` and `path:filename`.

#### ChatGPT:
The difference between `path:path` and `path:filename` lies in their usage and semantics.

In a Flask application, routes can use dynamic route parameters to allow dynamic values in URLs. For example, we can use `<filename>` as a dynamic parameter to allow clients to access `http://example.com/docs/index.html` or `http://example.com/docs/about.html`, etc. In Flask, dynamic route parameters have the format `<parameter_name>[:<converter>]`, where `parameter_name` is the name of the parameter and `converter` is an optional converter that converts the parameter value to a specific type. If no converter is specified, it defaults to string type.

Therefore, in `path:filename`, `filename` is a dynamic route parameter representing the requested file name. Using the `path:` prefix allows this parameter to be treated as a string containing path information. For example, if the client requests the URL `http://example.com/docs/path/to/file.html`, then the value of `filename` will be `path/to/file.html`.

On the other hand, in `path:path`, `path` is the parameter name representing a string containing path information. Unlike `path:filename`, this route parameter does not have a specific name and can be named any valid Python variable name. For example, we can define the route as `@app.route('/<path:file_path>')` and name the parameter `file_path` to represent the requested file path. In this case, if the client requests the URL `http://example.com/docs/path/to/file.html`, then the value of `file_path` will be `path/to/file.html`.

In summary, the difference between `path:path` and `path:filename` lies in their names and semantics. `path:filename` represents the requested file name, while `path:path` represents the requested file path.

#### You:
How does a Flask server save user state? When the first access is received, it will receive a token, I need to save this token so that it's available during the period of this access.

#### ChatGPT:
In Flask, you can use sessions to save user state information. Sessions are a technique for storing user data on the server side, allowing Flask applications to share data across multiple requests. In Flask, session data is stored in client-side cookies, and the content of the cookie is signed and encrypted by the server to ensure its integrity.

To use sessions in a Flask application, you can use the `session` object provided by Flask. In each session, Flask generates a unique Session ID for each client and stores this Session ID in a cookie. You can store any Python object in the Flask `session` object; these objects are automatically serialized into strings and stored in cookies. To retrieve data from `session`, you can use the `session.get(key, default=None)` method or the `session[key]` syntax.

In your case, when the client first accesses the server, you can store the token provided by the client in the session so that it can be used in subsequent requests. For example, here is an example of using Flask sessions to save tokens:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your-secret-key'  # Set a key for signing and encrypting cookies

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    token = request.form.get('token')
    session['token'] = token  # Store the token in the session
    return 'Logged in successfully.'

@app.route('/protected')
def protected():
    token = session.get('token')
    if token is None:
        return 'You are not logged in.'
    # Use the token for verification here, verify successful then return static content
    return 'Protected content.'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this example, when a client sends a POST request to the `/login` route, the server stores the token provided by the client in the session. Then, when a client requests the `/protected` route, the server retrieves the stored token from the session and uses it for verification. If verification is successful, return protected content; otherwise, return unauthorized message.

Note that to use Flask sessions, you need to set a key (i.e., `app.secret_key`) in your application, which is used to sign and encrypt cookies. This key should be a random string and should not be leaked.

#### You:
Do you have any recommendations on how to generate this key?

#### ChatGPT:
Generating a random key can use the `secrets` module in Python, which provides functions for generating secure random numbers. In a Flask application, you can use the `secrets.token_hex(nbytes)` function to generate a string of a specified length that can be used as the value of `app.secret_key`.

For example, here is an example of using the `secrets` module to generate a random key:

```python
import secrets

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = secrets.token_hex(16)  # Generate a string of 16 bytes as the secret key
```

In this example, we use the `secrets.token_hex(16)` function to generate a string of 16 bytes and set it as the value of Flask application's secret key.

Additionally, if you are using Flask-WTF or Flask-Session such Flask extensions, these extensions will automatically use the Flask application's secret key to sign and encrypt data, so you do not need to generate a separate key for these extensions.

#### You:
I want to set an expiration time for this key, how can I implement it?

#### ChatGPT:
In Flask, the application's secret key (`app.secret_key`) is not an object that has an expiration time. It is usually generated when the application starts and remains constant during the application's runtime.

If you want to implement a key with an expiration time, you can consider using third-party libraries (such as `cryptography`) to generate JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). JWT is an open standard for transmitting information securely over the network. It can contain user authentication and authorization information, along with metadata such as expiration time.

For example, here is an example of generating a JWT with an expiration time using the `cryptography` library:

```python
import datetime
import jwt

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'mysecretkey'  # Set JWT secret key
app.config['JWT_EXPIRATION_DELTA'] = datetime.timedelta(seconds=3600)  # Set JWT expiration time to 1 hour

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    # Perform user authentication here
    if authenticated:
        # If authentication is successful, generate a JWT and return it to the client
        payload = {'sub': '1234567890', 'exp': datetime.datetime.utcnow() + app.config['JWT_EXPIRATION_DELTA']}
        token = jwt.encode(payload, app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'], algorithm='HS256')
        return {'access_token': token.decode('UTF-8'), 'token_type': 'Bearer'}
    else:
        return {'error': 'Authentication failed'}

@app.route('/protected')
@jwt_required()
def protected():
    # If JWT verification is successful, return the protected resource
    return {'data': 'Protected resource'}
```

In this example, we use the `jwt.encode()` function to generate a JWT and return it to the client. The expiration time of the JWT is set through the `JWT_EXPIRATION_DELTA` configuration item, here set to 1 hour. When accessing protected resources, we use the `@jwt_required()` decorator to verify the validity of the JWT. If the JWT verification is successful, return the protected resource; otherwise, return error information.

Note that the security of JWT depends on the confidentiality of the key, so in actual applications, you should take measures to protect the key's confidentiality. At the same time, JWT also has some security risks such as CSRF attacks, etc., which need to be paid attention to during implementation.
