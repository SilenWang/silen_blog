As expected, just like I bought a tablet and spent two days reading books before starting to play PSP emulators... this time after buying a computer, I didn't use it for software testing for long either... I immediately started playing Monster Hunter. I even fiddled with how to record video from the client machine on the host... After struggling all day, I finally chose dual-streaming of video and audio... separately through the Looking-Glass and Scream projects to stream video and audio back to the host, and then recorded using OBS on the host. As for why I didn't record directly on the client machine... that wouldn't reflect the essence of being a masochist, right!

Here's a test video of me playing Cherry Fire Dragon without any technical skill:
