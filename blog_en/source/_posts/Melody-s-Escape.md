I don't know where the original song came from, but I heard it while playing Melody's Escape...

One of the main features of this game is music selection. The official version only comes with 5 songs (including this Regain Control), but you can choose any music you have (supporting MP3s, WMAs, iTunes, FLAC formats, etc.). Running through your favorite ACG songs one by one is quite enjoyable~

For fans of video games, Melody's Escape should be relatively easy. There are only eight keys in total... If I were a handless beginner like me when first playing a video game, starting with Medium (four keys) would be easier to get the hang of. Once both hands have some feel for it, you can try the eight-key version.

I think it's best to start with songs that have strong rhythm if you're new to the game. Most of the keys are on the beat points in these songs, making them easier to press.

Personally, I played for about a week and found that relatively simple and enjoyable songs were:

AlieZ, Î²ios, X.U, Hero's Come Back, only my railgun, hollow World

The only regret is that this game is currently a single-player game. I wonder if the author will add local multiplayer mode in the future...
