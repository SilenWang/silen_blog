During the Mid-Autumn Festival, I didn't have to work and finished the last two cases of Protagonist 2 in one go. The script is not inferior to the three-part series of "Step into the Law," and the second-to-last case, "Future Science and Return of the Dead," left a deeper impression on me...

<!-- Summary -->

There are two researchers involved in this case. One of them, during their student days, stole corpses to sell to the university's medical school for survival and research funding... The other researcher firmly believed that their theory was correct but lacked funds to verify it, only to be exploited by a cunning businessman to defraud government research grants.

What impressed me were two points:

- Students stealing corpses for medical research, even being instructed by teachers to do so, is indeed something that occurred in the history of medicine. The production team researched this and incorporated it into the story, which was quite thoughtful.
- The experiences of the two researchers were completely different, but they both reflected a problem: young researchers need not only talent but also resources or large amounts of money for scientific research. This contradiction still exists today... I wonder where the production team got their inspiration to write such a story with some social commentary.

Although I personally think that the script quality of Protagonist is comparable to "Step into the Law," if we consider its deeper meaning... Protagonist seems more profound and darker. The three-part series of "Step into the Law" contains many unrealistic elements, such as the trial of a parrot and a phone call, along with various exaggerated characters, making it fun to play without any issues.

Protagonist is very different. While I think the last case's plot was somewhat disconnected... the rest of the cases felt more like solving mysteries: the diplomatic dilemma in the case related to the British Assassin, the challenges faced by international students like Natsume Souseki, the困境 of young researchers seeking funding, and the emphasis on evidence, especially physical evidence, in court. All these elements make Protagonist feel more like a mystery-solving game rather than a carefully designed courtroom debate game.

I hope there will be a sequel!
