In our current single-cell analysis pipeline based on scanpy, there's a step that requires saving AnnData objects in loom format. However, unlike saving to h5ad format, when we write an AnnData object to a loom file without any special handling and then read it back, we find that the index information of `obs` and `var` (typically cell barcodes and gene names) is lost, and these indices become ordinary numeric identifiers.

## Problem Description

Based on actual testing and the documentation of the [write_loom method](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/anndata.AnnData.write_loom.html), it can be inferred that during actual read/write operations, `write_loom` does not save the index portions of the obs and var tables by default. Even when specifying the parameter `write_obsm_varm=True`, the writing process only creates two new columns with fixed names (obs_names and var_names).

According to the [read_loom method documentation](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/scanpy.read_loom.html), when reading, `read_loom` looks for a column named `CellID` in obs and a column named `Gene` in var to use as indices for the respective tables.

This creates a mismatch: by default, indices aren't saved, and even if they are saved, what `write_loom` writes and what `read_loom` reads don't align - it's like two departments failing to coordinate properly, resulting in the loss of critical information...

## Solution

My goal is to make minimal changes to the original pipeline code, so directly generating loom files that the original pipeline can read is the best approach:

```python
# Save index information to columns in obs and var
adata.obs['CellID'] = adata.obs.index.tolist()
adata.var['Gene'] = adata.var.index.tolist()

# Write to loom file (including obsm and varm information)
merge_adata.write_loom('/path/to/raw.loom')

# Read the loom file - since CellID and Gene exist,
# the read adata successfully preserves the index information of both tables
adata = sc.read_loom('/path/to/raw.loom')
```
