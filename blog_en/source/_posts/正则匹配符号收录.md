Regular expressions are still quite useful in many situations. However, there are some differences in how they are written across different programs, so it's a good idea to make a cheat sheet for reference!

- `\`: Escapes the next character, which can be a special character, an ordinary character, a backreference, or an octal escape. For example, `n` matches the character `n`. `\n` matches a newline character. The sequence `\\` matches `\`, and `\(` matches `(`.
- `^`: Matches the start of the input string. If the Multiline property is set on the RegExp object, `^` also matches `\n` or `\r` after positions.
- `$`: Matches the end of the input string. If the Multiline property is set on the RegExp object, `$` also matches `\n` or `\r` before positions.
- `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding subexpression. For example, `zo*` can match `z` and `zoo`. `*` is equivalent to `{0,}`.
- `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding subexpression. For example, `zo+` can match `zo` and `zoo`, but not `z`. `+` is equivalent to `{1,}`.
- `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding subexpression. For example, `do(es)?` can match `do` or `does` in `do`. `?` is equivalent to `{0,1}`.
- `{n}`: n is a non-negative integer. Matches exactly n occurrences. For example, `o{2}` cannot match the `o` in `Bob`, but it can match all `o`s in `food`.
- `{n,}`: n is a non-negative integer. Matches at least n occurrences. For example, `o{2,}` cannot match the `o` in `Bob`, but it can match all `o`s in `foooood`. `{1,}` is equivalent to `+`. `{0,}` is equivalent to `*`.
- `{n,m}`: m and n are non-negative integers, where n <= m. Matches at least n occurrences and no more than m occurrences. For example, `o{1,3}` will match the first three `o`s in `fooooood`. `{0,1}` is equivalent to `?`. Note that there should be no space between the comma and the two numbers.
- `?`: When this character follows any other quantifier (`*, +, ?, {n}, {n,}, {n,m}`), it makes the matching pattern non-greedy. Non-greedy mode matches as few characters as possible in the searched string, while the default greedy mode matches as many characters as possible. For example, for the string `oooo`, `o+?` will match a single `o`, and `o+` will match all `o`s.
- `.`: Matches any single character except `\n`. To match any character including `\n`, use the pattern `[.\n]`.
- `(pattern)`: Matches pattern and captures this match. Captured matches can be obtained from the generated Matches collection, in VBScript using SubMatches collection, in JScript using $0â€¦$9 properties. To match round bracket characters, use `\(` or `\)`.
- `(?:pattern)`: Matches pattern but does not capture the match result, i.e., a non-capturing group, which is useful when combining parts of a pattern with "or" characters. For example, `industr(?:y|ies)` is a more concise expression than `industry|industries`.
- `(?=pattern)`: Positive lookahead, matches at the start position of any string that matches pattern. This is a non-capturing group, which means this match does not need to be captured for later use. For example, `Windows (?=95|98|NT|2000)` can match `Windows 2000` in `Windows 2000`, but it cannot match `Windows 3.1` in `Windows 3.1`. Lookahead does not consume characters, so after a match occurs, the search for the next match starts immediately after the last match without starting from the character following the lookahead.
- `(?!pattern)`: Negative lookahead, matches at the start position of any string that does not match pattern. This is a non-capturing group, which means this match does not need to be captured for later use. For example, `Windows (?!95|98|NT|2000)` can match `Windows 3.1` in `Windows 3.1`, but it cannot match `Windows 2000` in `Windows 2000`. Lookahead does not consume characters, so after a match occurs, the search for the next match starts immediately after the last match without starting from the character following the lookahead.
- `x|y`: Matches x or y. For example, `z|food` can match `z` or `food`. `(z|f)ood` then matches `zood` or `food`.
- `[xyz]`: Character set. Matches any one of the characters contained within it. For example, `[abc]` can match `a` in `plain`.
- `[^xyz]`: Negative character set. Matches any character not contained within it. For example, `[^abc]` can match `p` in `plain`.
- `[a-z]`: Character range. Matches any character within the specified range. For example, `[a-z]` can match any lowercase letter from `a` to `z`.
- `[^a-z]`: Negative character range. Matches any character not within the specified range. For example, `[^a-z]` can match any character that is not a lowercase letter from `a` to `z`.
- `\b`: Matches a word boundary, i.e., the position between a word and a space. For example, `er\b` can match `er` in `never`, but it cannot match `er` in `verb`.
- `\B`: Matches a non-word boundary. `er\B` can match `er` in `verb`, but it cannot match `er` in `never`.
- `\cx`: Matches the control character specified by x. For example, `\cM` matches a Control-M or carriage return. The value of x must be A-Z or a-z; otherwise, c is treated as an ordinary `c` character.
- `\d`: Matches any digit character. Equivalent to `[0-9]`.
- `\D`: Matches any non-digit character. Equivalent to `[^0-9]`.
- `\f`: Matches a form feed. Equivalent to `\x0c` and `\cL`.
- `\n`: Matches a newline character. Equivalent to `\x0a` and `\cJ`.
- `\r`: Matches a carriage return character. Equivalent to `\x0d` and `\cM`.
- `\s`: Matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, form feeds, etc. Equivalent to `[\f\n\r\t\v]`.
- `\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character. Equivalent to `[^\\f\\n\\r\\t\\v]`.
- `\t`: Matches a tab character. Equivalent to `\x09` and `\cI`.
- `\v`: Matches a vertical tab character. Equivalent to `\x0b` and `\cK`.
- `\w`: Matches any word character, including underscores. Equivalent to `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.
- `\W`: Matches any non-word character. Equivalent to `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`.
- `\xn`: Matches n, where n is a two-digit hexadecimal escape value. The hexadecimal escape value must be exactly two digits long. For example, `\x41` matches `A`. `\x041` is equivalent to `\x04 &1`. Regular expressions can use ASCII encoding.
- `\num`: Matches num, where num is a positive integer. A reference to the captured match. For example, `(.)'\1` matches two consecutive identical characters.
- `\n`: Identifies an octal escape value or a backreference. If `\n` has at least n captured subexpressions before it, then n is a backreference. Otherwise, if n is an octal digit (0-7), then n is an octal escape value.
- `\nm`: Identifies an octal escape value or a backreference. If `\nm` has at least nm captured subexpressions before it, then nm is a backreference. If `\nm` has at least n captured subexpressions, then n is a backreference followed by the letter m. If none of the above conditions are met, if both n and m are octal digits (0-7), then `\nm` matches the octal escape value nm.
- `\nml`: If n is an octal digit (0-3) and both m and l are octal digits (0-7), then it matches the octal escape value nml.
- `\un`: Matches n, where n is a four-digit hexadecimal representation of a Unicode character. For example, `\u00A9` matches the copyright symbol (?)`.
