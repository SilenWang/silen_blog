This must be a historic moment!

<!-- more -->

A week ago, I read news that Steam's latest Linux version integrated a feature called Steam Play, which combined Wine and Proton, allowing users to run Windows games directly on Linux. They also provided a list of the first 27 games to be fully compatible (when this was written). At the time, I didn't care much because I thought this technology was still in development and would take a long time to mature.

But last night before bed, feeling bored, I decided to try Steam.............................................

Wow, it's amazing, truly super amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was running an old version of Xian Jie 4 that I had previously purchased. Just by clicking the mouse, I could play the game! On a cheap laptop with just Core M5!

F*ck...... my mood hasn't calmed down for hours.

How many ordinary users are unable to play enough games on Windows and end up being stuck with it, or delete Linux after trying dual-booting? This situation is expected to change dramatically in the next year and a half!

GTMD windows!
