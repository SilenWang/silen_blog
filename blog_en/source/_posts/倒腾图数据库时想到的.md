Recently, while organizing our materials for using graph databases, I thought of a problem. Actually, from a performance perspective, graph databases may not necessarily achieve better performance. For us, the significance lies in simplifying the requirements for database design.

<!-- Abstract -->
<!-- more -->

We have a lot of data with many interrelated aspects. For those of us who are not in the database-related industry, although it takes effort to clarify the actual logical relationships between the information we need to record, this is something that must and can be done. However, designing a suitable library and table to store these things... that's really a daunting task...

At this point, graph databases have an absolute advantage. Because... as long as the logic is clear, you can simply store it according to this logical relationship... So... the greatest significance of using this thing... is saving database structure design, and if you find that your logic isn't quite right, changing nodes is also easier...

That's all
