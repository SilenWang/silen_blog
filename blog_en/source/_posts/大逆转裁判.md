I have cleared the case in "The Great Ace Attorney". Personally, I feel that this game is even better than the Phoenix Wright trilogy. Compared to them, this game does not have any supernatural elements, and the part about evidence in the story seems more reasonable (not just moving an item/person out can be used as evidence). Of course, in a game centered on reasoning... I might be overthinking something~
