At one point, the biggest obstacle to my daily use of Linux distributions was the lack of QQ. Back then, I was a third-year student and QQ was an essential software for both learning and life. Although smartphones had already come into being, transferring files between phones and Linux computers was quite inconvenient at the time, and there wasn't even a WPS Linux version... So, I eventually switched back to Windows.

Last year, for some unknown reason, Tencent actually released an official Linux QQ. Although it's based on Electron, it doesn't seem to be using an open-source project from the internet; instead, it appears to have used the layout of the Mac version? The current interface is quite appealing:

Functionally, basic chat and file transfer work fine,表情包 display is also no problem, spaces and short videos are available, but other fancy features are missing for now. It's currently quite minimalistic...

So... When will the one that once claimed to be minimalistic take action?
